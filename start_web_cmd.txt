$ npx express-generator

For earlier Node versions, install the application generator as a global npm package and then launch it:
$ npm install -g express-generator
$ express

Display the command options with the -h option:
$ express -h

For example, the following creates an Express app named myapp. The app will be created in a folder named myapp in the current working directory and the view engine will be set to Pug:
express --view=pug myapp

Then install dependencies:
$ cd myapp
$ npm install

On MacOS or Linux, run the app with this command:

$ DEBUG=myapp:* npm start

On Windows Command Prompt, use this command:

> set DEBUG=myapp:* & npm start

On Windows PowerShell, use this command:

PS> $env:DEBUG='myapp:*'; npm start
